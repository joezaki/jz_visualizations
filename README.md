#### This repository is meant to store mainly the following files `plotly_vis.py` and `vispy_vis.py` in which exist utility functions for plotting using Plotly and VisPy, respectively.

#### The notebook file `plotly_vis_test_usage.ipynb` highlights some example use cases for using the `agg_plot()` and `correlation_plot()` functions.

#### The notebook file `vispy_vis_test_usage.ipynb` highlights some example use cases for using the Vis Class and associated methods for plotting images, lines, and scatterplots.

#### These are by no means exhaustive, but just exemplify some of the ways that the tools can be flexibly used.

The Plotly code relies on the use of the following packages, and this code was developed using the following versions:
- `plotly = 6.0.1`
- `numpy = 2.2.4`
- `pandas = 2.2.3`
- `scipy = 1.15.2`
- `statsmodels = 0.14.4`
- `matplotlib = 3.10.1`

The VisPy code relies on and was developed using:
- `vispy = 0.15.2`
- `pyqt = 5.15.11`
