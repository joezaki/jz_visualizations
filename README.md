This repository is meant to store mainly the following `visualizations.py` file in which exist utility functions for plotting using plotly.

The `visualizations_test_usage.ipynb` notebook file highlights some example use cases for using the `agg_plot()` and `correlation_plot()` functions.
These are by no means exhaustive, but just exemplify some of the ways that the functions can be flexibly used.

The file relies on the use of the following packages, and this code was developed using the following versions:
- `plotly = 6.0.1`
- `numpy = 2.2.4`
- `pandas = 2.2.3`
- `scipy = 1.15.2`
- `statsmodels = 0.14.4`
- `matplotlib = 3.10.1`
